                <h2>Aries </h2>
                <h4> March 21 - April 19</h4>
                
                <P> ...You're most compatible with Aquarius, Sagittarius, Leo, and Gemini.

                        Woah Nelly! Look at all those options, Aries! The reason for this has to do with the fact that Aries have a magnetic personality.</p>
            </p>

            <p>
                <h2>Leo </h2>
                <h4>June 21 - July 22</h4>
                <!----<img src= "imagesStarsign/leo.jpg" height = "200px" alt="lion painting on starry background"/>-->
                <p>...You're most compatible with Sagittarius, Libra, Gemini, and Aries.

                    Because Leos tend to be demanding when it comes to love, these signs share their determination, as well as their passion and deep appreciation for life. A lust for life, to be more specific.</p>
            </p>

            <p>
                <h2>Sagittarius </h2>
                <h4>November 22 - December 22</h4>
                <!----<img src= "imagesStarsign/saggitarius.jpg" height = "200px" alt="centaur painting on starry background"/>-->
                <p>.You're most compatible with Leo, Aries, Aquarius, and Libra.

                    Since Sagittarius can get bored easily and a lot faster than most, they are able to deliver and keep things nice and spicy, and Sagittarius on their toes..</p>
            </p>
        </div>

            <!------EARTH-->
        <div class="earthsigns">
            <p>
                <h1 class="element_header">Earth Signs</h1>
                <img src= "imagesStarsign/earth.jpg" height = "200px" alt="goat painting on starry background" class="element_img"/>
                <h2>Taurus </h2>
                <h4>April 20 - May 20</h4>
                <!----<img src= "imagesStarsign/Taurus.jpg" height = "200px" alt="bull painting on starry background"/>-->
                <p>...You're most compatible with Virgo and Pisces.

                    Taurus folk tend to get a bad rap for being stubborn, but the reality is that they're just full of determination and there's definitely something to be said for that. Virgos and Pisces are equally strong in their own way, making for one hell of a delightful romance.</p>
            </p>

            <p>
                <h2>Virgo </h2>
                <h4>August 23 - September 22</h4>
                <!----<img src= "imagesStarsign/virgo.jpg" height = "200px" alt="woman painting on starry background"/>-->
                <p>...You're most compatible with Taurus and Capricorn.

                    Since Virgo is an Earth sign, it's important that they stick to other Earth signs like Taurus and Capricorn. Not only do they complement each other, but they share a practical approach to all that life has to offer. And honestly, practical and practical goes together like peanut butter and jelly.</p>
            </p>

            <p>
                <h2>Capricorn </h2>
                <h4>December 22 - January 19</h4>
                <!----<img src= "imagesStarsign/capricorn.jpg" height = "200px" alt="fishtailed goat painting on starry background"/>-->
                <p>...You're most compatible with Pisces, Scorpio, Virgo, and Taurus.

                    It's these signs that are up for the challenge of getting straight to the point, as Capricorns prefer. You won't find any short-lived relationships here, but long, happy ones that will be able to withstand whatever is thrown their way.</p>

            <!---AIR-->
        <div class="airsigns">
            <p>
                    <h1 class="element_header">Air Signs</h1>
                    <img src= "imagesStarsign/air.jpg" height = "200px" alt="goat painting on starry background" class="element_img"/>
                    <h2>Gemini </h2>
                    <h4>May 20 - June 20</h4>
                    <!----<img src= "imagesStarsign/gemini.jpg" height = "200px" alt="twins painting on starry background"/>-->
                    <p>...You're most compatible with Aquarius and Libra.

                        Although the two personality aspect of Gemini can seem daunting, they're actually quite affectionate and sweet. Because of this, they appeal to Aquarius and Libra. Gemini also does pretty well with other Gemini, because they're able to handle each other in ways that other signs may not be able to. </p>
            </p>

            <p>
                <h2>Libra </h2>
                <h4>June 21 - July 22</h4>
                <!----<img src= "imagesStarsign/libra.jpg" height = "200px" alt="man holding weighing scales painting on starry background"/>-->
                <p>...You're most compatible with Leo and Sagittarius.

                    These signs enjoy the peaceful harmony that Libras can offer a romantic relationship. However, Libra can also be compatible with a fellow Libra, making for a "beautiful and peaceful relationship." (Note to self: Find a fellow Libra</p>
            </p>


            <p>
                <h2>Aquarius </h2>
                <h4>January 20 - Febuary 18</h4>
                <!----<img src= "imagesStarsign/aquarius.jpg" height = "200px" alt="lion painting on starry background"/>-->
                <p>...You're most compatible with Gemini and Libra.

                    As much as all these signs enjoy people, they put their freedom and independence above all else. Because of this, the need to have some alone time will never be an issue for a Gemini or Libra who dates an Aquarius, because they understand that need in ways that other signs may not.</p>
            </p>
        </div>

             <!---WATER-->
        <div class="watersigns">
            <p> 
                    <h1 class="element_header">Water Signs</h1>
                    <img src= "imagesStarsign/water.jpg" height = "200px" alt="goat painting on starry background" class="element_img"/>    
                    <h2>Cancer </h2>
                    <h4>June 21 - July 22</h4>
                    <!----<img src= "imagesStarsign/cancer.jpg" height = "200px" alt="crab painting on starry background"/>-->
                    <p>...You're most compatible with Scorpio and Pisces.

                        Because Cancers can be a bit jealous and often in need of attention, Scorpios can fit the bill for this. Pisces, on the other hand, is a match that can have a smooth-sailing relationship, void of too much drama.</p>
            </p>

            <p>
                    <h2>Scorpio</h2>
                    <h4>October 23 - November 21</h4>
                    <!----<img src= "imagesStarsign/scorpio.jpg" height = "200px" alt="scorpion painting on starry background"/>-->
                    <p>...You're most compatible with Scorpio and Pisces.

                        "They make for an unusual couple, but they have a high level of success when it comes to love and relationships," says Green. It's the mysterious quality that these signs share that make for a powerful union of love and happiness.</p>
            </p>

            <p>
                    <h2>Pices </h2>
                    <h4>February 19 - March 20</h4>
                    <!----<img src= "imagesStarsign/pisces.jpg" height = "200px" alt="fish painting on starry background"/>-->
                    <p>...You're most compatible with Scorpio and Cancer.

                        For Pisces, the need to be with fellow water signs, Scorpios and Cancers, is the best way to insure a relationship that's harmonious and long-lasting. There's an understanding of moods there, because of the shared water sign.
                        
                        Even if you're skeptical about astrological signs and their compatibility, if you're a Gemini who's been dating everyone but Libras, and it hasn't worked out, then it might be time to take your zodiac sign to heart. There's nothing wrong with trying something new, especially if what you've been doing hasn't been working out so well.</p>
